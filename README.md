# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the efficacy of Amazon's paid Vine program for product reviews. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members who then review the product. The main question for this analysis is whether or not there is a positive bias skew for the data.

# Results
The main results of the analysis are as follows:

**How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?**

# Summary: 

Based particularly on the results of 2.3, there is a positivity bias for the Amazon Vine reviews. 39% of product reviews on Amazon are positive, compared to 51% for the Amazon Vine reviews. Another analysis that could be conducted to support this would be to evaluate the negative reviews, and see if there are a lower percentage of one star reviews for Vine products than overall. However, the dataset used for Vine reviews is very small, which may make this sample unrepresentative of the whole. Additional analyses on other Vine datasets should be conducted to confirm the results of this particular analysis.
